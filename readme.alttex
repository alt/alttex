This is an experimental LaTeX package, using the XeTeX engine, some XeLateX packages and unicode features to offer a new way of working with LaTeX. Well, that’s exaggerated, but still it might be a nice toy.
At the moment, the package is growing dayly.
Read the pdf by clicking on ”raw“.
To compile the package: download the .dtx and .ins, put them in a directory and load the alttex.ins with xelatex. Then you get the alttex.sty which you can put anywhere where LaTeX will find it.
